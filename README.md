## Ansible is an open-source automation tool that allows us to automate configuration management, application deployment, and task automation.

## It uses YAML files for configuration and automation tasks.

## Ansible is agentless, meaning it doesn't require any software to be installed on the target machines, instead it uses SSH to connect to and manage remote servers.
